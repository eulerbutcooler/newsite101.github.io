### Interning at Murty Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology

Guided by Prof. N Apurva Ratan Murty

- Modelling effects of **adversarial perturbations** on an image throughout its journey inside a Convolutional Neural Network, specifically explored ResNet50.
- This exploratory research helps compare how human and machine vision deal with slight environmental perturbations and how robustness can be achieved.
